This is really cool, I am building a web page!

<h1>Create the Repository</h1>
<!-- <strong> makes my text bold!, you can either use <b> for Bold or <I> for italics but it doesn't give meaning to ur text    -->
<p>That’s it! You have <a href="http://www.github.com">successfully</a> connected the repository you created on GitHub to your local machine. To test this, <strong>you can cd into the new git_test folder that was downloaded</strong> and then enter git remote -v on your command line. This will display the URL of the repository you created on GitHub, which is the remote for your local copy. You may have also noticed the word origin at the start of the git remote -v output, which is the name of your remote connection. The name “origin” is both the default and the convention for the remote repository. But it could have just as easily been named “party-parrot” or “dancing-banana”. (Don’t worry about the details of origin for now; it will come up again near the end of this tutorial.)</p>
